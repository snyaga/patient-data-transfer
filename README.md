# patient-data-transfer

HI4Kenya BootCamp 2015 Project

We intend to create an openMRS module to capture a Patient's medical history:
    *personal info to begin with
    *previous encounters later

in a compressed JSON/XML file and securely transfer it between remote instances of openMRS.

Web/user interface: Depends on the openMRS uiframework(hopefully)

Data Representation: JSON/XML

Data encryption: TBD

Data Export: in - progress

Data Import:  in - progress

Remote Connection : To be made using REST API
