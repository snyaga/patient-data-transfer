# patient-data-transfer

HI4Kenya BootCamp 2015 Project

We intend to create an openMRS module to capture a patient's medical history (previous encounters & personal info) 
in a compressed JSON file and transffer it between different instances of openMRS.

Web/user interface: Depends on the openMRS uiframework
Data encryption: TBD
